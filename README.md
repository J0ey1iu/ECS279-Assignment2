# ECS279-Assignment2
This is the HW for ECS279-Winter-2020
## Summary
Basically went through all 6 steps of requirements. Built the model myself in blender, rigged it, animated it, imported it to unity, and did keybinding for `w`, `UpArrow` and `space`. Only 2 animations are available and the model won't actually move forward if you press `w` or `UpArrow`.
